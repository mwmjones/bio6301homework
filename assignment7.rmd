$5^{n=day}$ points taken off for each day late.

50 points total.

Submit a single knitr file (named `homework7.rmd`), along with a valid PDF output file. Inside the file, clearly indicate which parts of your responses go with which problems (you may use the original homework document as a template). Add your name as `author` to the file's metadata section. Raw R code/output or word processor files are not acceptable.

Failure to name file `homework7.rmd` or include author name may result in 5 points taken off.

### Question 1 ###

**14 points**

Use the following code to generate data for patients with repeated measures of A1C (a test for levels of blood glucose).

```{r}
genData <- function(n) {
    if(exists(".Random.seed", envir = .GlobalEnv)) {
        save.seed <- get(".Random.seed", envir= .GlobalEnv)
        on.exit(assign(".Random.seed", save.seed, envir = .GlobalEnv))
    } else {
        on.exit(rm(".Random.seed", envir = .GlobalEnv))
    }
    set.seed(n)
    subj <- ceiling(n / 10)
    id <- sample(subj, n, replace=TRUE)
    times <- as.integer(difftime(as.POSIXct("2005-01-01"), as.POSIXct("2000-01-01"), units='secs'))
    dt <- as.POSIXct(sample(times, n), origin='2000-01-01')
    mu <- runif(subj, 4, 10)
    a1c <- unsplit(mapply(rnorm, tabulate(id), mu, SIMPLIFY=FALSE), id)
    data.frame(id, dt, a1c)
}
x <- genData(500)
```

Perform the following manipulations: (2 points each)

1. Order the data set by `id` and `dt`.
2. For each `id`, determine if there is more than a one year gap in between observations.  Add a new row at the one year mark, with the `a1c` value set to missing.  A two year gap would require two new rows, and so forth.
3. Create a new column `visit`.  For each `id`, add the visit number.  This should be 1 to `n` where `n` is the number of observations for an individual.  This should include the observations created with missing a1c values.
4. For each `id`, replace missing values with the mean `a1c` value for that individual.
5. Print mean `a1c` for each `id`.
6. Print total number of visits for each `id`.
7. Print the observations for `id = 15`.

### Question 2 ###

**10 points**

Import the `addr.txt` file from the GitHub repository.  This file contains a listing of names and addresses (thanks google).  Parse each line to create a data.frame with the following columns: lastname, firstname, streetno, streetname, city, state, zip.  Keep middle 
initials or abbreviated names in the firstname column.  Print out the entire data.frame.

### Question 3 ###

**2 points**

The first argument to most functions that fit linear models are formulas.  The following example defines the response variable `death` and allows the model to incorporate all other variables as terms. `.` is used to mean all columns not otherwise in the formula.

```{r}
url <- "https://github.com/fonnesbeck/Bios6301/raw/master/datasets/haart.csv"
haart_df <- read.csv(url)[,c('death','weight','hemoglobin','cd4baseline')]
coef(summary(glm(death ~ ., data=haart_df, family=binomial(logit))))
```

Now imagine running the above several times, but with a different response and data set each time.  Here's a function:

```{r}
myfun <- function(dat, response) {
  form <- as.formula(response ~ .)
  coef(summary(glm(form, data=dat, family=binomial(logit))))
}
```

Unfortunately, it doesn't work. `tryCatch` is "catching" the error so that this file can be knit to PDF.

```{r}
tryCatch(myfun(haart_df, death), error = function(e) e)
```

What do you think is going on?  Consider using `debug` to trace the problem.

**5 bonus points**

Create a working function.
